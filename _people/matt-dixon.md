I'm a research assistant in PaCT Lab working on the Cybersecurity Across the Lifespan Project (Csalsa). I studied a psychology undergraduate degree here at Northumbria followed by the psychology MRes course where I began working alongside researchers in both the Psychology and Computer Science departments where I published by first paper - a late breaking work piece for the CHI 2019 conference. My research focuses on a range of security topics. I currently work with older adults, investigating topics such as how older adults perceive issues of security and privacy relating to healthcare technologies. I also work on James Nicholson's Cyber Guardians project where we train older adults to become knowledgeable peers who can assist others in their communities with security issues. Previously, my work has focused on phishing and younger users, particularly how smartphone design features may cause users to be more vulnerable to phishing attacks.
