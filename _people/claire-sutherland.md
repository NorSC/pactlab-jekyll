I started a part-time PhD in March 2012 looking at opening up the lines of communication over cyberbullying between youths, parents and teachers. I completed my Undergraduate degree at Abertay University, Dundee in 2004 (BSc (Hons) Forensic Psychobiology in 2004, first class). In 2006 I completed a PGCE in Primary Education at Dundee University. I currently work in a primary school in Melbourne, Australia and have started my PhD remotely. My PhD involves researching a clear definition of cyberbullying by focusing on youths, parents and teachers perceptions. It will then investigate what behaviours are perceived as cyberbullying with a final aim of providing intervention strategies which will open the communication channels between cybervictims and adults.
