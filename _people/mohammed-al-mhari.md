I started full-time at Northumbria University in March, 2013. I completed my Masters in Internet Computer and System Security in University of Bradford , UK in 2008 and my Project title was Measuring and Managing Risk. I then completed 4 years teaching experience in information security in Salalah College of Technology in Oman. My PhD research involves investigations on employees’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in information security within the higher educational sector in Oman. In my research, I have adopted a mixed methods approach, using both qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a deeper understanding of employees’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviour related to information security awareness. In the first phase of this research, I completed face-to-face interviews with IT and network administrators in two colleges/universities in Oman. The literature review and qualitative results, has resulted in the design of a questionnaire that will be disseminated online to employees in different colleges and universities in Oman. This questionnaire uses a scenario approach to understanding how staff will behave in different situations.
