I am a psychologist working in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). I am a Senior Lecturer in the Psychology Department at Northumbria University, based in the Psychology and Communication Technology (PaCT) Lab, and Visiting Associate at Newcastle University. Previously, I was the Senior Researcher for three successive multidisciplinary EPSRC projects: IMPRINTS, ReelLives and the DERC (Digital Economy Research Centre). IMPRINTS assessed the UK publics' intentions to engage with identity management technology of the future. ReelLives explored the ways in which individuals could take ownership of their digital identity. DERC aimed to improve digital provisions for the volunteering community. I have a keen interest in the role of technology in life transitions, and I am currently researching the impact of technology use in motherhood; in particular, work-life balance for new parents.
