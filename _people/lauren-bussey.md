I started my full-time PhD at Northumbria University in October 2015. I previously completed a BSc (hons) in Psychology in 2014, and an MSc in Health Psychology in 2015 at Northumbria University. My MSc thesis research investigated the impact of rosemary aroma on the prospective memory of healthy older adults, and featured on the Trust Me Iâ€™m a Doctor programme in July 2015. My research interests include improving and promoting healthy behaviours and behaviour change interventions. I am also interested in how the internet can support health and wellbeing, and how online information informs/ contributes toward real life health decisions.
