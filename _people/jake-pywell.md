I joined PaCT Lab in 2015 as I assisted on the ACANTO project while studying for my BSc (Hons) Psychology degree which I completed in 2017. I am now working towards my PhD which I started in March 2018. My PhD focuses around digital mental health interventions for depression and how their implementation could be aided for older adults. This includes a mixed-method approach to investigating older adultâ€™s attitudes towards digital mental health interventions and the barriers that they may face during the uptake of digital mental health interventions and during their use.
