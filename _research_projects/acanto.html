ACANTO (www.ict-acanto.eu) is a Horizon 2020 project designed to improve
    people’s social and physical wellbeing and focuses on the 60+,
    post-retirement demographic. The ACANTO system has four major components
    that are under development:


    •             The FriWalk is a robotic guide situated in centres of
    interests (e.g. shopping centres and museums) which people can use during
    their visit. It can provide physical support, navigation instructions, and
    even virtual tours. This device also has a clinical version, used in
    hospitals and rehabilitation centres to assess patients, recommend
    exercises, and monitor progress over time. The nexus of these devices
    provides a system of support for patients who have left rehabilitation and
    need support to be more physically and socially involved.


    •             A social network links users together based on similar
    interests (e.g. local history, art, and theatre) and recommends activities
    for them to do together. These recommendations are customised, may involve
    people users do not previously know, and aim to encourage social and
    physical involvement.


    •             A recommender system that gathers data from the user both
    explicitly (via the social network) and implicitly (based on geographical
    habits and interaction with the devices) to suggest activities for them to
    do with other people.


    •             The FriTab is a device/app that allows the user to control the
    FriWalk and access the social network.
