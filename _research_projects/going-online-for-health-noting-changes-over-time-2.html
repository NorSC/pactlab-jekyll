<p>As part of an ongoing project PactLab researchers have used survey
methodology to take a snapshot of e-health users every five years since the
year 2000 in order to assess changing patterns of use and engagement with
online health information and advice. A large scale questionnaire has
allowed us to note changes in website use and to model the factors that
predict trust in online health advice across a range of different user
groups.</p>
