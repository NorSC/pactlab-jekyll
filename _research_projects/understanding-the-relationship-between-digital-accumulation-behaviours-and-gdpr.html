data and its protection is a key feature of the new GDPR. This includes
clear limitations on is collection, storage and use being outlined in law,
but also requires disclosure of data breaches, for which a high financial
penalty may be applied. Our research has demonstrated that the accumulation
and failure to delete digital data is very common, and lack of individual
and organisational awareness of exactly what data is being held, may lead to
inadvertent lack of compliance with GDPR, and also have cybersecurity
implications. In this project we aim to measure the extent of digital
accumulation of personal data, and interview stakeholder employees and
management to assess the extent of this issue, and how effective are current
organizational attempts to address employee understanding and compliance. We
also aim to gain insight into developing intervention strategies to
encourage employees to think more carefully about email deletion, especially
in relation to personal data.</span></p>
