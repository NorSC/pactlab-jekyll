<p><div class="enigma_blog_full"><div class="enigma_blog_post_content"><p>•
to ‘provide an overview of the ways in which trust is either assessed or
asserted in relation to the use and provision of resources in the Web
environment for research and learning’;<br>• to ‘assess what solutions might
be worth further investigation and whether establishing ways to assert trust
in academic information resources could assist the development of
information literacy’;<br>• to ‘help increase understanding of how
perceptions of trust influence the behaviour of information
users.’</p></div></div></p>

<p><div class="enigma_blog_full"><div
class="enigma_blog_post_content"><p>The project proposed a model for trust
in online learning environments and identified external design cues, cues
internal to the content of the information and the user’s cognitive state as
important variables in deciding what information to
trust.</p></div></div></p>
