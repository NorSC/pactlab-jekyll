  class="enigma_blog_post_content"><p>The value of patient choice, self care,
  and patient and public involvement has been increasingly noted in the health
  sector. These aims cannot be achieved unless people can access high quality
  health information. Traditionally, health information has been based on
  facts and figures of the illness, and very few of them contained information
  on patient’s experiences (PEx). It is argued that people seek more than
  scientific facts. They want to know more about how other people with the
  same condition have experienced, and be able to share their own experience
  with others. Knowing other people’s experience has the potential to affect
  decision making, reduce one sense of isolation, and improve adjustment to
  the disease. At the same time, there are also concerns that PEx might have a
  negative effect of an individual if the experience of others contains strong
  emotional content, or is not directly relevant. This project will examine
  how people use, search for, and select PEx in online health sites or online
  support groups, and how exposure to PEx might influence recall and health
  decisions. Understanding how people use PEx online might have important
  implications for health care professionals on whether, when, and how they
  should incorporate PEx into online health information sites or online
  support groups.</p></div></div></p>
