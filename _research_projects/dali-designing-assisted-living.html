class="enigma_blog_post_content"><p>This is an FP7 European funded project.
The aim of the DALi project is to produce a device that will prolong
out-of-home mobility for older adults. One key to successful ageing is the
ability to stay independently mobile, enabling sustained levels of physical
and social activity. In DALi, we pursue autonomous mobility through the
development of our “c-walker”. This aid will provide physical, cognitive and
emotional support to older adults in public environments such as shopping
centres and airports.</p></div></div></p>

crowded and unstructured spaces by acquiring sensory information, and
deciding on a path that minimises the risk of accidents. This is an
assistive technology, as such, recommendations are passed to the user who
remains in control of the final decision.</p></div></div></p>
