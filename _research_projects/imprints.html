<p><p>IMPRINTS (Identity Management – Public Responses to Identity
Technologies and Services) was a comparative and multidisciplinary research
project, asking about the influences on UK and US publics to engage and/or
disengage with identity management practices, services and technologies of
the future. These involved, among others, new forms of biometric
authentication; innovative ‘smart’ tokens like ID or customer cards,
jewellery, garment, or further enhanced smart phones. These technologies
have become subject to paradoxical processes of acceptance and rejection,
with members of the public warmly embracing the one and fiercely rejecting
the other. In this research we gained a better understanding of these
paradoxes in order to facilitate public debate, policy development and
user-centric applications.</p></p>
