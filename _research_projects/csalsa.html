<p class="paragraph_style_1">In the cSALSA project, we take a lifespan
approach to studying how cyber-security is understood, and the attitudes and
behaviours of people to cyber-security and risk.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style_1">The project studies cyber-security across three
main life stages - amongst young people, those of working age, and older
people. The research project focuses on how people's attitudes and
behaviours towards cyber-security and risk change across the lifespan in
sync with their goals and aspirations, cognitive abilities and knowledge and
ability to control and adapt their cyber-security behaviour.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style_1">Importantly, we recognize that neither
cyber-security related behaviours nor life course development occur in a
vacuum. Rather, they are part of a complex inter-play of individual
characteristics, elements shared with others in a particular life stage, and
the dynamic context in which the person finds themselves. These contexts
include aspects of family life, organizational structures, cognitive
capacity and knowledge, and social support networks.</p>
