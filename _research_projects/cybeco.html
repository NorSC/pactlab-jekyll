CYBECO will research, develop, demonstrate, evaluate and exploit a new
framework for managing cybersecurity risks, one that is focusing on
cyberinsurance, as key risk management treatment. CYBECO integrates
multidisciplinary research methods from Behavioural Economics, Statistics,
Game and Decision Theory, Security Engineering and Behavioral Psychology in
order to develop new concepts and models that are combined within a
prototype software architecture (CYBECO Toolbox 2.0). CYBECO recognizes that
the cyberinsurance domain is not adequately developed, partly due to the
lack of sufficiently large statistical data sample and partly due to the
difficulties customers face when deciding on their cyberinsurance investment
options. CYBECO will address both these barriers, aiming at delivering
advances clearly positioned beyond the State-of-the-Art. We plan to
implement a prototype tool that will demonstrate and promote the CYBECO
model and concepts. We then foresee to perform behavioural experiments to
validate current institutional cybersecurity frameworks and to provide
relevant policy insights, particularly in reference to behavioural nudges in
cybersecurity. The CYBECO consortium is composed by complementary partners,
coming from the addressed research, technological and market domains, that
have a proven track record of high quality research capacity. Thus, the
carefully structured workplan, embodies a holistic approach towards meeting
the CYBECO objectives and delivering market-relevant outcomes of significant
exploitation potential.
