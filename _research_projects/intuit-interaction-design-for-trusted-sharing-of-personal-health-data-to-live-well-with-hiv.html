<p>This EPSRC funded project seeks to identify and address fundamental
Trust, Identity, Privacy and Security (TIPS) challenges faced by those
managing stigmatised long term conditions including HIV in managing their
health and interacting with care services, peer support networks, and
private organisations. We will develop new tools providing people with
opportunity and choice for managing the trusted sharing of their
self-generated data with others. We will envision innovative service
propositions that are grounded in a new empirical understanding of
challenging but highly relevant contexts for sharing these data. INTUIT
brings together experts in HIV Medicine, Public Health, Human Computer
Interaction, Design, Health Psychology, Health Informatics and Applied
Ethics with colleagues in Design at Northumbria but also Bristol University,
City University, Edinburgh and UCL.</p>
