_Health-related searches have become one of the most common reasons for using the Internet. The Internet has played an increasingly important role for patients in making health care decisions and this supported by the growing evidence that patients often bring information retrieved from the Internet into medical consultations as an aid to decision making.  Whilst many people appear to trust the information they find online there are concerns that this trust may be misplaced given that  systematic reviews have concluded that quality is a problem on the Internet. In the face of such variable quality, how do health consumers decide whether or not to trust the information and advice they find online?_

_The Internet is also an increasingly popular mode to deliver health interventions, as it can; reduce costs, increase convenience for users, reach isolated or stigmatised groups and can provide an ‘any time’ service. In addition, given the direct and indirect costs of obesity, low cost, high impact interventions must be considered the most attractive to policy makers and stakeholders._

The PaCT Lab has a proven track record of investigating trust in online health information.  A 3 year ESRC funded project rated outstanding  examined how people engage with and trust online health information and advice. The team developed novel methodologies to explore issues associated with trust development and maintenance. The project demonstrated three key techniques:

- Internet café style labs: Health users are invited into the lab to view websites and take part in group discussions. We can record which sites they visit and how long they spend on each site.

- Large scale online questionnaire development: We have been successful attracting large numbers of online respondents.

- Eye tracking: We have used eye tracking equipment to record which features of websites draw attention from different health users.

The project led to a published set of guidelines for the design of good health websites and follow ups with a number of health care providers and pharmaceutical companies.
