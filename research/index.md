**Our work is conducted in the field or in a dedicated suite of laboratories with video editing facilities, eye-tracking equipment and a range of software analysis tools. We have good participant panels, including a panel of three hundred older adults (aged 75+). We have an excellent track record of inclusive research (i.e. we encourage the engagement of all sectors of society).**

Our research is funded by the UK government (through research councils) and by industry.

Our work covers four broad themes of privacy, security, trust, and behaviour change which map onto the following domains: Cyber Security, Older adults &amp; Technology, Energy, E-health, and Social media.
