	<h2>James Nicholson</h2>

	<p>James is a Lecturer in the School of Computer and Information Sciences. James is interested in inclusive cybersecurity and leads the CyberGuardians research project. He is also interested in usable security, social engineering, and everyday surveillance. Previously, James was a senior researcher in PaCT Lab working on the Cybersecurity Across the Lifespan (cSALSA) project. The project explores how cyber-security is understood, and the attitudes and behaviours of people to cyber-security and risk. During his time in PaCT Lab, James also worked on Choice Architecture for Information Security (ChAISe), Digital Economy Research Centre (DERC), and the Horizon 2020 project CYBECO. Prior to PaCT Lab, James worked at Open Lab, Newcastle University on the TEDDI and SiDE projects. James’ work has focused on improving user authentication, both by repurposing existing graphical authentication systems and by evaluating novel ones. He is also interested in user privacy and how groups of users (children, parents, older adults) experience location tracking technologies, as well as how CCTV video can be crowdsourced to de-centralise the surveillance landscape. More recently, he has developed tools and methodologies for uncovering and understanding employees’ mental models of security threats with the aim of improving training programmes and/or organisational policies, as well as practical means for improving users’ protection against these security threats (e.g. phishing).</p>

	<h2>Lynne Coventry</h2>

	<p>Lynne Coventry is the Director of PaCT Lab (Psychology and Communication Technology) at the University of Northumbria. Lynne is best known for her work on usable security, particularly biometrics. Her research interests are varied and she is currently involved in research exploring the role of communication technology in the lives of older adults to facilitate mobility and inclusion, the role of trust in student’s use of online information, the usability of medical products and the design of usable security. She is an applied researcher who enjoys working in multidisciplinary teams to solve real problems. She is keen to explore new ways of integrating psychology into design and technology development processes. She has a multidisciplinary background with a BSC in Psychology and Computing Science, an MSc in Software Engineering and a PhD in Human Computer Interaction. While her early career was spent as a research fellow and lecturer at Stirling University, Heriot Watt and Dundee university, the majority of her career has been as a researcher within Industry (both computing and medical products) working to incorporate understanding of people, their use and acceptance of technology into the requirements and design process. Lynne is a founding member of the Scottish Usability Professional Association and previous vice president. Lynne is a founding member of STEPS, and current Editor of Interfaces (A British Computer Society Magazine) and a reviewer for a number of international conferences and journals.</p>

	<h2>Pam Briggs</h2>

	<p>I hold a Chair in Applied Psychology at Northumbria University and am a Visiting Professor at Newcastle University. My work primarily addresses issues of identity, trust and security in new social media, seeking answers to three main questions: Why and when do we feel secure in disclosing sensitive identity information about ourselves? What makes us trust an electronic message? How and when do we seek to protect our privacy? In the last five years, I’ve secured over £2m in research funding, have published over forty articles on human perceptions of trust, privacy and security in computer-mediated communication and have developed, with colleagues, a new model of health advice-seeking online. I’m one of the founder members of the UK’s Research Institute in the Science of Cybersecurity, funded by GCHQ in association with RCUK’s Global Uncertainty Programme and my most recent research awards address both usable and inclusive privacy and security. My latest projects (see projects page) concern cybersecurity across the lifespan (cSALSA), the human side of cyber and cloud crime (CRITICAL) and attitudes and decision-making behaviours around cyberinsurance (CYBECO). I’m also a co-investigator on the Digital Economy Research Centre (DERC) where I’ve been exploring ways to democratise context-relevant data collection and analysis and explore the design of digital platforms for social action.</p>

She is a member of the PACT (Psychology and Communication Technologies) Lab – part of the Centre for Cognition and Communication. Her research interests are focussed on trust and online interactions particularly within an e-health context. Liz is currently exploring trust exchanges within online health communities and examining the influence of online patient experience on behaviour and decision making. Liz has also written on ethical issues in mobile human-computer-interaction and has a keen interest in qualitative methodologies. She has attracted (as Col) large research council grants both in the UK and jointly with colleagues in the USA. She has published over 20 articles on trust, privacy and online communication and regularly presents her work at national and international conference.

	<h2>Santosh Vijaykumar</h2>

	<p>Santosh is a health and risk communication scientist with research interests at the intersection of public health, behavioural science and new media technologies. Specifically, he studies mobile and social media interventions for addressing global health challenges with a focus on tropical and infectious diseases. Santosh’s research analyses and evaluates the effects of both, bespoke innovations (like crowdsourced surveillance applications) as well as generic platforms (like Twitter and Facebook) on individuals, communities and health systems during infectious disease outbreaks. The research approach involves mixed methodologies, trans-disciplinary conceptualization and collaborations with policymakers, activists and the industry. His work, spanning the US, Singapore, Sri Lanka and India, has been published in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, Journal of Medical Internet Research, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and Journal of Nutrition Education and Behaviour among others.</p>

	<h2>Lisa Thomas</h2>

	<p>I am a psychologist working in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). I am a Senior Lecturer in the Psychology Department at Northumbria University, based in the Psychology and Communication Technology (PaCT) Lab, and Visiting Associate at Newcastle University. Previously, I was the Senior Researcher for three successive multidisciplinary EPSRC projects: IMPRINTS, ReelLives and the DERC (Digital Economy Research Centre). IMPRINTS assessed the UK publics’ intentions to engage with identity management technology of the future. ReelLives explored the ways in which individuals could take ownership of their digital identity. DERC aimed to improve digital provisions for the volunteering community. I have a keen interest in the role of technology in life transitions, and I am currently researching the impact of technology use in motherhood; in particular, work-life balance for new parents.</p>

	<h2>Matt Dixon</h2>

	<p>I’m a research assistant in PaCT Lab working on the Cybersecurity Across the Lifespan Project (Csalsa). I studied a psychology undergraduate degree here at Northumbria followed by the psychology MRes course where I began working alongside researchers in both the Psychology and Computer Science departments where I published by first paper - a late breaking work piece for the CHI 2019 conference. My research focuses on a range of security topics. I currently work with older adults, investigating topics such as how older adults perceive issues of security and privacy relating to healthcare technologies. I also work on James Nicholson’s Cyber Guardians project where we train older adults to become knowledgeable peers who can assist others in their communities with security issues. Previously, my work has focused on phishing and younger users, particularly how smartphone design features may cause users to be more vulnerable to phishing attacks.</p>

	<h2>Mohammed Al-Mhari</h2>

	<p>I started full-time at Northumbria University in March, 2013. I completed my Masters in Internet Computer and System Security in University of Bradford , UK in 2008 and my Project title was Measuring and Managing Risk. I then completed 4 years teaching experience in information security in Salalah College of Technology in Oman. My PhD research involves investigations on employees’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in information security within the higher educational sector in Oman. In my research, I have adopted a mixed methods approach, using both qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a deeper understanding of employees’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviour related to information security awareness. In the first phase of this research, I completed face-to-face interviews with IT and network administrators in two colleges/universities in Oman. The literature review and qualitative results, has resulted in the design of a questionnaire that will be disseminated online to employees in different colleges and universities in Oman. This questionnaire uses a scenario approach to understanding how staff will behave in different situations.</p>
